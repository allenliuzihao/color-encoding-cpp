# color-encoding-cpp
This repository contains a few useful utilities functions for converting floating point formats between FP16 and FP32. It also has a few useful functions to encode color formats including R10G10B10A2, R11G11B10, and R9G9B9E5. Unit tests are included. 

This repository would be useful to understand 

1. how f16tof32 and f32tof16 works in HLSL intrinsics.
2. how HDR and LDR color encoding works for UINT render targets. 

Doing this project helped me understand floating point representations in more depth. Plus, it's a lot of fun.
